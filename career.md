<h2>Acting</h2>

<p>Murphy attended Verne Fowler School of Dance and Theatre Arts in Colonia, New Jersey, in 1982. From the age of four, she trained in singing, dancing, and acting until her move to California at thirteen. Murphy made her Broadway debut in 1997, as Catherine, in a revival of Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge opposite veteran actors Anthony LaPaglia and Allison Janney.</p>

<p>Murphy landed her first job in Hollywood when she was thirteen, starring as Brenda Drexell in the series <i>Drexell's Class.</i> She then went on to play Molly Morgan in the short-lived <i>The Torkelsons</i> spinoff <i>Almost Home.</i> Murphy also guest-starred on several television series, including <i>Parker Lewis Can't Lose, Blossom, Quest 2032, Murder One</i> and <i>Frasier.</i> She also had recurring roles on <i>Party of Five, Boy Meets World,</i> and <i>Sister, Sister.</i></p>

<p>Murphy's breakthrough role was in her second feature film, the teen comedy <i>Clueless</i> (1995), directed by Amy Heckerling, which developed a cult following. She followed this with roles in <i>Freeway</i> (1996), with Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland, and the independent comedy <i>Bongwater</i> (1998). In 1999, she had a supporting role in James Mangold's <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> as a troubled psychiatric patient alongside Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie; and as an aspiring beauty queen in <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous.</i> She also voiced the character Luanne Platter on Fox's animated sitcom <i>King of the Hill</i> for the entirety of the show's run from 1997 to 2009, and Joseph Gribble until the fifth season. She was nominated for an Annie Award for voice acting in the <i>King of the Hill</i> episode "Movin' On Up".</p>

<p>She began the 2000s with a leading role in <i>Don't Say a Word</i> (2001) alongside Michael Douglas; the TV adaptation of the novel <i>The Devil's Arithmetic</i> (2001); <i>8 Mile</i> (2002), for which she received critical acclaim; and <i>Uptown Girls</i> (2003). In 2003, she starred in the romantic comedies <i>Just Married</i> and <i>Little Black Book</i> (2004) and the critically acclaimed <i>Sin City</i> (2005). Film critic Roger Ebert frequently acclaimed Murphy's acting talent and comedic timing, giving good reviews to several of her films and comparing her to Lucille Ball:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>As for Brittany Murphy, for me, it goes back to the 2003 Independent Spirit Awards where Murphy was assigned to present one of the awards. Her task was to read the names of the five nominees, open an envelope, and reveal the name of the winner. This she turned into an opportunity for screwball improvisational comedy, by pretending she could not follow this sequence, not even after the audience shouted instructions and the stage manager came to whisper in her ear not once but twice. There were those in the audience who were dumbfounded by her stupidity. I was dumbfounded by her brilliance.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Murphy followed with several independent films, including as <i>Spun</i> (2002), <i>Neverwas</i> (2005), and Karen Moncrieff's <i>The Dead Girl</i> (2006), as well as two Edward Burns films: <i>Sidewalks of New York</i> (2001) and <i>The Groomsmen</i> (2006). She returned to voice acting with the critically acclaimed 2006 animated feature <i>Happy Feet,</i> as Gloria Penguin. In 2009, she was cast in the Lifetime TV movie <i>Tribute,</i> as the main character, Cilla. Murphy completed the thriller/drama <i>Abandoned</i> in June 2009 and it was released in 2010, after her death. In November 2009, Murphy left the production of <i>The Caller,</i> which was being filmed in Puerto Rico, and was replaced by Rachelle Lefevre. Murphy denied media reports that she had been fired from the project after being difficult on set, and cited "creative differences". <i>Something Wicked,</i> her final film, was released in 2014.</p>
  
  <h2>Music</h2>
 <p>Murphy's career also included work as a singer. She commented, "My singing voice isn't like my speaking voice...I've just always kept it a secret and never taken credit because I wanted to learn how to work behind the microphone in a recording studio, and some of the singers don't even know it was me recording on their albums."</p>

<p>She was in a band called Blessed Soul with fellow actor Eric Balfour in the early 1990s. On June 6, 2006, Murphy and Paul Oakenfold released the single "Faster Kill Pussycat", from the album A Lively Mind. The song became a club hit and hit number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart. It also hit number seven in Oakenfold's native United Kingdom in June 2006.</p>

<p>She dabbled in music again with the release of the film Happy Feet, in which she covered Queen's "Somebody to Love" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "Boogie Wonderland". Murphy said about her character, Gloria, "Oddly enough, of all the characters I've played, Gloria is the most like me. And she's a penguin! George Miller always wanted one person to do both [the speaking and the singing]. I said, 'I can sing,' and I asked him to give me a shot. I don't think he took me very seriously, because most actors say they can do most things."</p>
