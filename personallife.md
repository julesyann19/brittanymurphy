  <h1> Personal Life </h1>

  <p>In late 2002, Murphy began dating Ashton Kutcher, her co-star in <i>Just Married.</i> Once engaged to talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz, Murphy became engaged to Joe Macaluso in December 2005, a production assistant she met while working on the film <i>Little Black Book.</i> In August 2006, they ended their engagement. In May 2007, Murphy married British screenwriter Simon Monjack in a private Jewish ceremony in Los Angeles.[27] For the last three-and-a-half years of her life, Murphy, her mother and Monjack lived together in the same house.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, Murphy lost a large amount of weight, which led to rumors of a cocaine addiction. In 2005, Murphy disputed such claims to Jane magazine, saying, "No, just for the record, I have never tried it in my entire life." At this point, she had recently signed as the spokesmodel for Jordache jeans.</p>
